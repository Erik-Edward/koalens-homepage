    <h1>Terms of Service for KoaLens</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: April 18, 2025</em></p> <!-- Updated date -->

    <p>Welcome to KoaLens! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the mobile application KoaLens ("the App"), provided by KoaLens ("we", "us", or "our"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Usage License</h2>
    <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial use in accordance with these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Eligibility and Age Requirement</h2>
    <p>To use KoaLens, you must be at least 13 years old (or the age required to consent to the processing of personal data in your country). By using the App, you represent that you meet this age requirement. The App is not intended for children under 13.</p>

    <h2>App Functionality</h2>
    <p>The App uses AI (via Google Gemini API) and our own backend systems to analyze video recordings of ingredient lists and provide an indication of the products' vegan status, as well as identify any watched ingredients. The App also includes an E-number database and features to save history and watched ingredients locally.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>The results from the App's analyses are intended as guidance only and do not constitute a guarantee. AI technology is not infallible, and inaccuracies in the interpretation of ingredient lists or E-number data may occur. Factors such as production changes, cross-contamination, or unclear ingredient lists can affect the results. You are solely responsible for double-checking information if you have strict dietary needs, allergies, or other sensitivities. We disclaim all liability for decisions made based on information from the App.</p>

    <h2>Permitted Use and Usage Limits</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use the App for illegal purposes or in a manner that could damage, disable, or overburden the App or its underlying systems (including third-party services like Google Gemini API and our backend servers).</p>
    <p>Your use of the AI analysis features may be limited to a certain number of analyses per time period (e.g., per month), as specified in the App. We reserve the right to change these limits.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App and all its content (excluding user-generated data stored locally and data from third-party services) are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services and Backend</h2>
    <p>The App's functionality depends on external services, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Gemini API:</strong> For AI-based video analysis. Your use is subject to Google's terms.</li>
        <li><strong>KoaLens Backend:</strong> Our own servers (managed via Supabase) used to handle analysis requests, usage counters, and potential account features.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your use of the App implies that you understand and accept that data may need to be sent to these services for the App to function.</p>

    <h2>Changes to the Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated via the App or our website. Your continued use of the App after changes take effect means you accept the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including if you breach these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about these Terms of Service, please contact us at <a href="mailto:koalens.app@gmail.com">koalens.app@gmail.com</a>.</p>
