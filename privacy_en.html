    <h1>Privacy Policy for KoaLens</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: April 18, 2025</em></p> <!-- Note: You might want to update this date to the actual date -->

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how KoaLens ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our mobile application KoaLens ("the App").</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We strive to minimize the collection of personal data. The App collects the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Video recordings of ingredient lists:</strong> When you use the video analysis feature, the video recording is sent to the Google Gemini API for processing. The video recording is temporarily processed on our servers before being forwarded to the Google Gemini API to identify ingredients and determine vegan status. We do not permanently store the video recordings themselves after the analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis results and history:</strong> The results from your scans (including identified ingredients, status, and timestamp) are saved locally on your device so you can access your history.</li>
        <li><strong>User-defined watched ingredients:</strong> Ingredients you add for monitoring are saved locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>User account information (if applicable):</strong> To enable features such as usage counters or potential future features like synchronization or premium access, we may collect and store an anonymized user identifier (User ID) linked to your device or account via our backend provider Supabase. If you register an account, your email address may also be collected.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymous usage data:</strong> We may collect anonymous, aggregated data about how the App is used (e.g., which features are popular, crash reports) via tools like Firebase Analytics to improve the App's performance and user experience. This data cannot be linked to you as an individual.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide the App's core functionalities (video analysis, E-number check, history, watched ingredients, usage counter).</li>
        <li>To analyze and improve the App's function and usability (via anonymous data).</li>
        <li>To communicate with Google's servers (Gemini API) to perform the AI analysis.</li>
        <li>To communicate with our own backend servers (managed via Supabase) to handle usage counters and potential account features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your scan history and watched ingredients are stored only locally on your device. User ID and related data for usage counters are stored securely with our backend provider Supabase. We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information processed through us and our third-party services, but we cannot guarantee absolute security, especially during data transmission over the internet.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Gemini API:</strong> For ingredient analysis via AI. Your use is subject to Google's Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. Data may be transferred to Google's servers globally.</li>
        <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> For backend features such as managing usage counters and user identification. Their data processing is governed by Supabase's Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play:</strong> For distributing the App. Use is governed by Google Play's terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics (or similar):</strong> For collecting anonymous usage data. Governed by Google's policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since most data (history, watched ingredients) is stored locally, you have full control over it. You can clear your scan history and remove watched ingredients at any time directly in the App. If you uninstall the App, all local data will be deleted.</p>
    <p>If you have created an account or if data linked to your anonymized User ID is stored on our servers (via Supabase), you have the right to request access to or deletion of this data. Contact us at <a href="mailto:koalens.app@gmail.com">koalens.app@gmail.com</a> to make such a request.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not directed to individuals under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data without your consent, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers and systems.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new policy within the App or on our website.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
